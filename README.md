# Pelle Öhrn, copywriter
This is the website for my dad's copywriting business, [www.pelleohrn.se](https://www.pelleohrn.se/). It's a simple single page application created with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (and [BEM](http://getbem.com/) where Tailwind has issues, most notably in CSS Grids) as well as [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icon elements.
