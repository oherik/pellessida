# Pelle Ã–hrn, copywriter
This is the website for my dad's copywriting business, [www.pelleohrn.se](https://www.pelleohrn.se/). It's a simple single page application created with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (and [BEM](http://getbem.com/) where Tailwind has issues, most notably in CSS Grids), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icon elements, and [a prerender plugin](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin) for better SEO.
